PROBLEM 3: Space Complexity and Space-Time Tradeoffs

a) Time complexity

Implementation A (Nested loop):
For each prerequisite (m), scan completed courses (n)
Time = m * n
So complexity: O(mn)

Implementation B (HashSet):
Build HashSet from completed courses: O(n)
Check prerequisites in set: O(m)
Total complexity: O(n + m)

b) Space complexity

Implementation A:
Uses constant extra space
Space: O(1)

Implementation B:
Stores n elements in hash set
Space: O(n)

c) Given:
n = 40, m = 5, students = 100,000 per day

Implementation A total comparisons per day:
per student = mn = 540 = 200
per day = 200 * 100,000 = 20,000,000 comparisons/day

Implementation B total memory usage per day:
Each hash set entry uses 8 bytes
memory per student = 40 * 8 = 320 bytes
memory for 100,000 students = 320 * 100,000 = 32,000,000 bytes
= about 30 MB

d) Constraints:
(i) Response time under 10ms per check
(ii) Memory under 1GB for 10,000 concurrent requests
Each comparison takes 0.1 microseconds

Implementation A time:
200 comparisons * 0.1 microseconds = 20 microseconds
= 0.02 ms (under 10 ms)

Implementation B memory:
memory per request = 320 bytes
10,000 requests = 320 * 10,000 = 3,200,000 bytes
= about 3.2 MB (under 1 GB)

Conclusion:
Implementation B is preferred because it is faster for large data and still within memory constraints.

e) Hybrid approach

If m is very small (1-2 prerequisites):
Use Implementation A because overhead of hash set is unnecessary.

If m is large (20+ prerequisites):
Use Implementation B because it avoids repeated scanning.

For n = 40, switching at around m = 3 is reasonable.
