PROBLEM 2: Time Complexity Analysis and Comparison

Given:
n = 10,000,000 users

a) Worst case comparisons for n = 10,000,000

Algorithm A (Linear Search):
Worst case comparisons = n
= 10,000,000 comparisons

Algorithm B (Binary Search):
Worst case comparisons = ceil(log2(n))
log2(10,000,000) ≈ 23.25
So comparisons ≈ 24

Algorithm C (Hash Table Lookup):
Average case comparisons ≈ 1
So ≈ 1 comparison

b) Big-O Time Complexity

Algorithm A: O(n)
Algorithm B: O(log n)
Algorithm C: O(1) average

c) Comparison table

n Linear Search Binary Search (log2 n) Hash Lookup
100 100 7 1
1,000 1,000 10 1
10,000 10,000 14 1
100,000 100,000 17 1
1,000,000 1,000,000 20 1
10,000,000 10,000,000 24 1

Observation:
Linear grows very fast, binary grows slowly, hash remains constant.

d) 50,000 checks per second, each comparison takes 1 nanosecond

Algorithm A:
1 search = 10,000,000 ns = 0.01 sec
50,000 searches = 50,000 * 0.01 = 500 sec (not possible)

Algorithm B:
1 search = 24 ns
50,000 searches = 50,000 * 24 = 1,200,000 ns = 0.0012 sec (possible)

Algorithm C:
1 search = 1 ns
50,000 searches = 50,000 ns = 0.00005 sec (possible)

Conclusion:
Hash lookup is best, binary is also acceptable, linear is not suitable.

e) When is sorting worth it for binary search?

Sorting time = O(n log n)
Binary search per query = O(log n)
Linear search per query = O(n)

Let k = number of searches.

Binary approach cost:
n log n + k log n

Linear approach cost:
k n

Binary is better when:
n log n + k log n < k n

So:
k > (n log n) / (n - log n)

Meaning:
If there are many searches, sorting once and using binary search becomes worthwhile.
