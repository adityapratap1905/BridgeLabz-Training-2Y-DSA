PROBLEM 1: Algorithm Properties and Correctness

a) Check both algorithms using the five fundamental properties

Algorithm A:

Input:

Takes temperature[1..n] and n as input.

Output:

Returns average temperature.

Definiteness:

Every step is clearly defined.

Finiteness:

Loop runs exactly n times and stops.

Effectiveness:

Uses basic operations (addition and division) which can be performed easily.

Conclusion:
Algorithm A satisfies all five properties and is correct.

Algorithm B:

Input:

Takes temperature[1..n] and n as input.

Output:

Returns sum (intended to represent average).

Definiteness:

Steps are clear.

Finiteness:

Both loops end after finite steps.

Effectiveness:

Uses valid operations.

Conclusion:
Algorithm B satisfies the algorithm properties technically, but it is logically incorrect because it does not compute the correct average.

b) Step-by-step execution for input:
temperatures = [20, 25, 22, 24, 21], n = 5

Algorithm A:
total = 0
i=1: total = 0 + 20 = 20
i=2: total = 20 + 25 = 45
i=3: total = 45 + 22 = 67
i=4: total = 67 + 24 = 91
i=5: total = 91 + 21 = 112
average = total / n = 112 / 5 = 22.4

Output = 22.4 (Correct)

Algorithm B:
sum = temperature[1] = 20

First loop (adding):
i=2: sum = 20 + 25 = 45
i=3: sum = 45 + 22 = 67
i=4: sum = 67 + 24 = 91
i=5: sum = 91 + 21 = 112

Second loop (division repeated):
i=1: sum = 112 / 5 = 22.4
i=2: sum = 22.4 / 5 = 4.48
i=3: sum = 4.48 / 5 = 0.896
i=4: sum = 0.896 / 5 = 0.1792
i=5: sum = 0.1792 / 5 = 0.03584

Output = 0.03584 (Incorrect)

c) Identify the logical error in Algorithm B

Error:
Algorithm B divides the sum by n inside a loop that runs n times.

Correct method:
Average = Total / n (division should happen only once)

But Algorithm B effectively computes:
Total / (n^n)

This violates the mathematical principle of averaging because repeated division reduces the value incorrectly.

d) Compare Algorithm A and Algorithm B

Algorithm A:

Simple and easy to understand

Produces correct output

Time complexity is O(n)

Algorithm B:

More confusing

Produces incorrect output

Even though time complexity is O(n), it is not usable due to incorrect logic

Production choice:
Algorithm A should be used because correctness is the most important requirement.

e) Test strategy (minimum 5 test cases)

Normal case
Input: [20, 25, 22, 24, 21], n=5
Expected: 22.4

Single day case
Input: [30], n=1
Expected: 30

Zero days case
Input: [], n=0
Expected: should handle division by zero (error or return 0 safely)

Negative temperatures
Input: [-5, -10, -3], n=3
Expected: -6

Same temperatures
Input: [10, 10, 10, 10], n=4
Expected: 10

Large input
Input: 10,000 random temperature values
Expected: correct average and good performance
